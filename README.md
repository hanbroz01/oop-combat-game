# 🛡️ OOP Combat Game (WIP)

A **text-based Python combat game** showcasing **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts.  
This project is currently a **work-in-progress (WIP)**.

## Description

- Demonstrates **Python OOP principles**: classes, inheritance, and methods.  
- Features:
  - **Player** and **Monster** classes with health, power, and level
  - Attack and damage mechanics
  - Player leveling system
  - Monster rage mode
- Focused on **combat mechanics**; gameplay is minimal but functional for testing.

> ⚠️ **Work-in-progress:** Many features are still being added, such as full gameplay loops, multiple monsters, items, and a scoring system.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hanbroz01/oop-combat-game.git
cd OOP-Combat-Game
python main.py
```

## Usage

- Running `main.py` creates a **Player** and a **Monster** instance.
- The **Player** can attack the monster and vice versa.
- Health, power, and level changes are displayed in the console.
- Currently, this is primarily a test of **combat and OOP mechanics**.

## Features (Current WIP)

- Player leveling system
- Monster rage mechanic (power doubling)
- Combat with damage tracking
- Prevents health from dropping below zero
- Console feedback for actions

## Future Plans

- Multiple monsters per session
- Inventory, items, and healing mechanics
- Full game loop with turns and win/lose conditions
- Optional GUI interface

## Notes

- Intended as a **learning/prototype project**.
- Safe for testing **Python OOP concepts**.
